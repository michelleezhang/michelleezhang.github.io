# Notes
An HTML document is divided into two main parts: head and body.

** HEAD **
The head is where we put metadata -- data that describes the data for a page.
Tags used include:
* Meta tags
- charset: tells the browser to use a certain character encoding (text to machine code), e.g. the UTF-8 encoding
- http-equiv: tells servers stuff about the page
- viewport: sets the viewport, e.g. it can be set so the width of the screen is always the full width of the device
- description: the summary of your page that shows up in search results
- keywords: keywords that help search engines know what your page is about
* Title tag: this is the title that appears on the webpage tab
* Links: links are external files that we can link to our page -- use "rel" (relation) to specify what the relationship is between the page and the linked file.
- preload: these are files (e.g. fonts) that will be loaded more immediately than others, which can help the page load quicker overall
- stylesheet: links an external stylesheet (external stylesheets allow us to change the style of many HTML pages at once, while internal stylesheets are specific to each page)
- icon: links to an image file for the web page's icon

** BODY **
* Header
- The header contains the navigation bar, which is formatted as an unordered list (ul) -- this is a nicer way to format things
